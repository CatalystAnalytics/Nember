# Welcome to Nember API Docs

For the web app visit [nember.catalystanalytics.io](https://nember.catalystanalytics.io).

## Getting Started

The docs are broken down into sections for each kind of prediction. For instance `Entry Predictions` will be in their own section. If the section does not end in `Predictions` then it is a general route.

Required prior to using API:

* API Key from the web app.
* Programming language of choice.

The API is used in correlation to the web app for users training models for their trading bots/algorithms. **NOTE** Any asterisk (`*`) means it is **required**.
